0|judging from previous posts this used to be a good place , but not any longer .;
1|we , there were four of us , arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude .;
2|they never brought us complimentary noodles , ignored repeated requests for sugar , and threw our dishes on the table .;
3|the food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny .;
4|after all that , they complained to me about the small tip .;
5|avoid this place !;
6|i have eaten at saul , many times , the food is always consistently , outrageously good .;
7|saul is the best restaurant on smith street and in brooklyn .;
8|the duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world .;
9|the wine list is interesting and has many good values .;
10|for the price , you can not eat this well in manhattan .;
11|i was very disappointed with this restaurant .;
12|ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away .;
13|i had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish ive requested .;
14|food was okay , nothing great .;
15|chow fun was dry ; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family .
16|i / we will never go back to this place again .;
17|went on a 3 day oyster binge , with fish bringing up the closing , and i am so glad this was the place it o trip ended , because it was so great !;
18|service was devine , oysters where a sensual as they come , and the price ca n ' t be beat ! ! !;
19|you ca n ' t go wrong here .;
20|every time in new york i make it a point to visit restaurant saul on smith street .;
21|everything is always cooked to perfection , the service is excellent , the decor cool and understated .;
22|i had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible .;
23|and i hate to say this but i doubt i ' ll ever go back .;
24|the food is very average . . . the thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet , every thing they serve is too sweet here .;
25|the only thing i moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree .;
26|i had never had edamame pureed before but i thought it was innovative and tasty ( could ' ve used a bit more salt ) .;
27|the decor is night tho . . . but they really need to clean that vent in the ceiling . . . its quite un - appetizing , and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern .;
28|we went around 9 : 30 on a friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great !;
29|the perfect spot .;
30|food - awesome .;
31|service - friendly and attentive .;
32|ambiance - relaxed and stylish .;
33|do n ' t judge this place prima facie , you have to try it to believe it , a home away from home for the literate heart .;
34|the food is decent .;
35|however , it ' s the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth .;
36|i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self - respect , which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me , i . e . make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water , or the check .;
37|i know , you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored , but my agenda is i ' m here to eat and enjoy the company of friends , seeking a pleasant experience .;
38|well , i did n ' t find it there , and trust , i have told everyone i can think of about my experience .;
39|the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty . hmmm .;
40|i had a great experience .;
41|food is great .;
42|service is top notch .;
43|i have been going back again and again .;
44|it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency - not too fishy , creamy , and slightly buttery .;
45|the sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned .;
46|the rice to fish ration was also good - - they did n ' t try to overpack the rice .;
47|we took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it .;
48|surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth .;
49|in the evening , this place attracted a well dressed , with it , ny crowd .;
50|the food was well prepared and the service impecable .;
51|i ' m going back .;
52|quite simply it ' s like stepping out of manhattan and into a haven of tranquility .;
53|i will be going back and heartily recommend it !;
54|it is terrific , as is the value .;
55|$ 6 and there is much tasty food , all of it fresh and continually refilled .;
56|i am not a vegetarian but , almost all the dishes were great .;
57|go hungry and enjoy .;
58|i like the somosas , chai , and the chole , but the dhosas and dhal were kinda disappointing .;
59|the service varys from day to day - sometimes they ' re very nice , and sometimes not .;
60|the kitchen however , is almost always slow .;
61|if you ' ve ever been along the river in weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer .;
62|add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening .;
63|the lava cake dessert was incredible and i recommend it .;
64|once you step into cosette , you ' re miraculously in a small , off - the - beaten path parisian bistro .;
65|this tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets , with that certain parisian flair .;
66|the food was average to above - average ; the french onion soup filling yet not overly impressive , and the desserts not brilliant in any way .
67|however , go for the ambience , and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world !;
68|the pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was n ' t even fully melted !;
69|it looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips .;
70|this has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in brooklyn .;
71|the pizza is overpriced and soggy .;
72|yes , they use fancy ingredients , but even fancy ingredients do n ' t make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right .;
73|a big disappointment , all around .;
74|i think i ' ve had some the best meals of my life at minnow .;
75|the seafood is amazing , there ' s a good wine list , and the ever - changing menu always offers some great surprises .;
76|the combination of super - fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious .;
77|worth the trip from manhattan .;
78|best pastrami i ever had and great portion without being ridiculous .;
79|my wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it .;
80|as a japanese native , i ' ve lived in the tristate area for over 8 years , but i was just so amazed at this place .;
81|this place is the most japanese it can ever get .;
82|the signs , the specials menus , food , and even all the waitstaff are all totally japanese .;
83|this place is worth an one - hour drive .;
84|i am so coming back here again , as much as i can .;
85|leon is an east village gem : casual but hip , with well prepared basic french bistro fare , good specials , a warm and lively atmosphere .;
86|my wife and i always enjoy the young , not always well trained but nevertheless friendly , staff , all of whom have a story .;
87|decent wine at reasonable prices .;
88|our teenage kids love it , too .;
89|everytime i decide to try another place on the ues , i get angry that i did n ' t just go to zucchero pomodori .;
90|this is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood .;
91|the service is excellent , the decor is great , and the food is delicious and comes in large portions .;
92|i ' m partial to the gnocchi .;
93|this place is incredibly tiny .;
94|they refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends .;
95|the hostess is rude to the point of being offensive .;
96|the food was bland oily .;
97|i just do n ' t understand all the hype . . .;
98|we have been to this place many times , and always have great food , wine , and service .;
99|we were worried we would have trouble getting in , but somehow managed to have a short wait .;
100|as always we had a great glass of wine while we waited .;
101|when we sat , we got great and fast service .;
102|the people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in new york sometimes .;
103|this is a fun restaurant to go to .;
104|the pizza is yummy and i like the atmoshpere .;
105|but the pizza is way to expensive .;
106|a large is $ 20 , and toppings are about $ 3 each .;
107|i went there for lunch and it was not as good as i expected from the reviews i read .;
108|sauce was watery and the food did n ' t have much flavor .;
109|i do n ' t think i would go again .;
110|this place is great .;
111|the waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal !;
112|service was prompt , friendly and great .;
113|slightly on the pricey side but worth it !;
114|great pizza and fantastic service .;
115|there was a small wait , but shorter than i expected .;
116|located at the end of a magnificent block .;
117|very cozy and warm inside . . . . .;
118|i will be back !;
119|this is the best sushi in new york city - hands down .;
120|the place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic .;
121|planet thailand has always been a hit with me , i go there usually for the sushi , which is great , the thai food is excellent too .;
122|with the great variety on the menu , i eat here often and never get bored .;
123|the atmosphere is n ' t the greatest , but i suppose that ' s how they keep the prices down .;
124|it ' s all about the food ! !;
125|first it took us a long time to find the place .;
126|but when we looked at the menu , there were n ' t a lot of choices , most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section .;
127|those rolls were big , but not good and sashimi was n ' t fresh .;
128|they were dry and disgusting , i did n ' t even finish my first piece .;
129|hurley ' s is like cheers where everyone knows your name and they are actually glad you came .;
130|try the crunchy tuna , it is to die for .;
131|try everything for that matter , it is all good .;
132|i have been going there since it opened and i ca n ' t get enough .;
133|first went here to enjoy their garden terrace .;
134|the food was amazing , and the service was prompt and helpful , but not over - bearing or rushed .;
135|the steak tartare is a great bet , they fix it for you at the table .;
136|admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm , but the open kitchen is part of the charm .;
137|great wine selection , gigondas is worth the price , and the house champagne is a great value .;
138|it may be a bit packed on weekends , but the vibe is good and it is the best french food you will find in the area .;
139|have recommended the place to friends , always gets good response .;
140|pizza - the only pizza in nyc that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best , freshly baked bread !;
141|i take all my nyc guests to vt ' s .;
142|not sure where the previous reviewer , lonk , dined , but saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food !;
143|i ' ve been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences .;
144|i ' d highly recommend it for a special occasion - - it provides and intimate setting and nice service .;
145|i ' m not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and i all enjoy mizu very much . . . and we ' re repeat customers .;
146|even after they overcharged me the last time i was there .;
147|it ' s delicious !;
148|moules were excellent , lobster ravioli was very salty !;
149|took my mom for mother ' s day , and the maitre d ' was pretty rude .;
150|told us to sit anywhere , and when we sat he said the table was reserved .;
151|stepped on my foot on the second time he reached over me to adjust lighting .;
152|tiny dessert was $ 8 . 00 . . . just plain overpriced for what it is .;
153|the drinks are always well made and wine selection is fairly priced .;
154|try their chef ' s specials - - they are to die for .;
155|service is not exactly five star , but thats not really a big deal .;
156|downstairs lounge is always a good attraction;
157|the exotic food is beautifully presented and is a delight in delicious combinations .;
158|it is also extremely well priced .;
159|the staff is incredibly helpful and attentive .;
160|the bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines .;
161|this is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed .;
162|your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem !;
163|when we stumbled on leon , we thought that we had found quite the gem but , we were certainly wrong .;
164|the waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet , we were told no . . .;
165|then , to top things off , she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend ' s jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes .;
166|such a disappointment . . .;
167|rude service , medicore food . . . there are tons of restaurants in ny . . . stay away from this one;
168|i loved everythig about it - especially the shows and actors .;
169|our server was very helpful and friendly .;
170|the food was good too .;
171|the tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent .;
172|the outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by 50 feet away on 6th avenue on a cool evening was wonderful .;
173|inside is a little cramped , but to be expected .;
174|service was prompt and courteous .;
175|this was a repeat visit and we ' ll definitely be back again .;
176|great service , great food .;
177|prices are in line .;
178|but too far east !;
179|the pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap , frozen , shredded cheese common to most pizzaria ' s .;
180|two complaints - - their appetizer selection stinks , it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu .;
181|also , because it is so thin , it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling .;
182|wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the uws !;
183|by far the best salad i have had in a fast food restaurant .;
184|over 100 different choices to create your own .;
185|a must try !;
186|on a recent sunday afternoon , a friend and i accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play doubt .;
187|this was the perfect quiet , relaxing , and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater .;
188|the chicken pot pie is exceptional , the cheeseburger huge and delictable , and the service professional wan warm .;
189|with so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district , is truly an excellent find !;
190|the staff is no nonsense .;
191|when i lived upstate for a while i would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else .;
192|worth visiting the 1st ave spot because it is the original store .;
193|he served me an uni hand roll , which i never had before , and let me tell you . . . it was heaven !;
194|the sake menu should not be overlooked !;
195|all in all , this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city .;
196|try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll .;
197|service was very good - prompt , attentive and non - intrusive .;
198|food was very good as well , considering that we tried the budget selection ( though i wish the pork belly that i ordered was roasted a bit longer , so that fat was more of a melt - in - your - mouth experience ) .;
199|wine list selection is good and wine - by - the - glass was generously filled to the top .;
200|traditional french decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation .;
201|i ' ve been to at cafe spice probably 5 - 8 times , it is probably still the best indian restaurant around union square .;
202|to sum it up : service varies from good to mediorce , depending on which waiter you get ; generally it is just average ok .
203|seating is always prompt , though the restaurant does fill up in the evening .;
204|food is usually very good , though ocasionally i wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders .;
205|as many other reviewers noticed , your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time .;
206|the decor is vibrant and eye - pleasing with several semi - private boths on the right side of the dining hall , which are great for a date .;
207|i have never been disappointed in the red eye .;
208|the first time i went , and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere , i ordered the lobster cobb salad .;
209|it ' s simply the best meal in nyc .;
210|you can not go wrong at the red eye grill .;
211|if we were to move from the upper east side , we would genuinely miss this restaurant .;
212|the restaurant is cute but not upscale .;
213|the food is a diamond in rough - - the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes .;
214|i would highly recommend it .;
215|it ' s one of our favorite places to eat in ny .;
216|we had a great time at the jekyll and hyde pub last night .;
217|after really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at a table and had dinner .;
218|the server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with a smile .;
219|the place ' s decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh .;
220|i highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks !;
221|if you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained , this is a great place to go and eat .;
222|the have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious , if i must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini .;
223|the entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner .;
224|you will not be disapointed at all .;
225|we were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem .;
226|the bagel was huge .;
227|the workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese ( gets a little messy ) .;
228|i loved it and would highly recommend .;
229|this was my frist time at cafe st . bart ' s and i must say how delicious the food and the service was .;
230|i have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo ; you can tell it was a fresh lobster .
231|other guests enjoyed pizza , santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips .;
232|i highly recommend cafe st . bart ' s for their food , the ambience and wonderful service .;
233|all the staff is absolutely professional ! !;
234|( that is a must , but not every restaurant can do . . . );
235|there ' s nice and quiet , small but enough for 6 ( or more ) .;
236|this restaurant was way overhyped .;
237|my chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily .;
238|okay - i do n ' t mind the oily part ( cause most are cooked that way ) but it was way too bland .;
239|the scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary .;
240|the service was the only thing good about this restaurant .;
241|it ' s boring on the inside , and our sushi was pretty below average . . . the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor .;
242|i definitely would n ' t go back .;
243|their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic .;
244|the price is reasonable although the service is poor .;
245|great for a romantic evening , or a fun evening with friends . . .;
246|i will be going back very soon .;
247|keep up the good work .;
248|it was wonderful .;
249|the salads are delicious , both refreshing and very spicy .;
250|we had pam ' s special fried fish and it was amazing .;
251|too large for just two people but nothing was left .;
252|great vibe , lots of people .;
253|my husbands was perfect , my was well done and dry .;
254|i did n ' t complain , i liked the atmosphere so much .;
255|on a hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch .;
256|ambience is so cute and quaint , good for business although we were there on vacation .;
257|salads were fantastic .;
258|although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great .;
259|ingredients are organic which is a real plus for me .;
260|we will be back .;
261|the spicy tuna roll is huge and probably the best that i ' ve had at this price range .;
262|the yellowtail was particularly good as well .;
263|i have reservations about the all you can eat deal , however - - the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $ 18 by just going off the menu .;
264|in any event , this is a place i ' ll be sure to stop by again when i ' m in this part of town .;
265|big wong gets big ups for a fine establishment .;
266|they have it all - - great price , food , and service .;
267|the atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can .;
268|the food is prepared quickly and efficiently .;
269|and it all comes at a very reasonable price ( congee , noodles , and rice dishes are no more than $ 3 - 6 each ) .;
270|the takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well .;
271|enjoyed a very nice caesar salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese . . . . both very tasty .;
272|we both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh .;
273|we concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake , both were delicious .;
274|we ' d go back again;
275|i recently went to this restaurant with some co - workers for lunch and had an amazing time .;
276|the staff was accomodating , the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely .;
277|we even had a visit from the manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves .;
278|yes , the prices are high , but i felt it was worth it .;
279|we all felt it was worth it .;
280|sometimes i get good food and ok service .;
281|sometimes i get bad food and bad service , sometimes i get good good and bad service .;
282|it is not consistent .;
283|the place is a bistro which means : simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere .;
284|and where does patis go wrong ; no where .
285|you are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but : cassuolet , steake fritte , tripe stew , etc ; simple stuff .
286|right off the l in brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza .;
287|mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta ( raddichio was kind of bitter though ) .;
288|my friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better .;
289|the sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day .;
290|kind of a small place but i guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids .;
291|overall i would recommend it and go back again .;
292|i started out with a bombay beer which was big enough for two .;
293|mmmmm . . . it was delicious .;
294|service was slow , but the people were friendly .;
295|it ' s a nice place to relax and have conversation .;
296|i ca n ' t wait to go back .;
297|the food is authentic italian - delicious !;
298|pizza is terrific , as is homemade pasta .;
299|ambience is delightful , service impeccable .;
300|service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great .;
301|do not try unless you ' re just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste .;
302|i go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try .;
303|this is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent .;
304|the filet mignon dish was superb !;
305|i would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices .;
306|it ' s a small cute restaurant .;
307|i absolutely love this place ! ! !;
308|i like the ambience , it ' s very dark and original .;
309|the sushi is amazing ! ! !;
310|and amazingly cheap .;
311|very affordable and excellent ambient !;
312|we ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the thai section of the menu but nothing we got was thai .;
313|we were very disappointed .;
314|we wo n ' t go to this place again for a good meal .;
315|however , i think this place is a good hang out spot .;
316|my girlfriend and i stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time !;
317|they tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter , so i ' m looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it .;
318|check this place out !;
319|highly recommended ! ! ! ! !;
320|first of all , this place is * not * romantic , as claimed by citysearch ' s editorial review .;
321|either that , or the editor ' s idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table , while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th .;
322|the tables are crammed way too close , the menu is typical of any italian restaurant , and the wine list is simply overpriced .;
323|slightly above average wines start at $ 70 + with only one selection listed at $ 30 + .;
324|service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category .;
325|for instance , plates were just dumped on the table , i was handed the wine list upside down , etc . . . .;
326|somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service .;
327|to be completely fair , the only redeeming factor was the food , which was above average , but could n ' t make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora .;
328|not one of our meals was edible - bland and / or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring .;
329|fish was overdone .;
330|cute place , nice wait staff but would never go there again .;
331|someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that .;
332|one of us actually liked the expresso - that ' s it .;
333|skip this restaurant , it ' s a big disappointment .;
334|myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the city ; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else .
335|i ' ve never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious .;
336|their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for .;
337|i come from a family of pizzeria owners , and i ' m almost ashamed to say that the pizza in fornino ' s blows my families receipies away .;
338|the place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious .;
339|i highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try .;
340|you will find yourself returning quite often .;
341|a restaurant that does n ' t try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere .;
342|no gimmicks here - - the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation .;
343|the dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over - - how refreshing !;
344|the service was impeccable and unobtrusive - - the staff knows what they are there to do - - to know their menu , present your meal , and attend to your needs .;
345|looking around , i saw a room full of new yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant , not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen .;
346|the view is breathtaking the service is top notch . . . the ambiance is wonderful .;
347|the staff offers impeccable service .;
348|i had lobster bisque it has 2 oz . of maine lobster in it .;
349|my boyfriend had the new england chowder it was good but i think the award should go to the lobster bisque .;
350|it was divine melts in your mouth .;
351|my boyfriend had prime rib it was good .;
352|we did n ' t want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of korbett it was just enough .;
353|it ' s cuz it ' s so good you need to taste it ! ! !;
354|all in all we ' re already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks ! ! ! !;
355|my wife and i ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food .;
356|if you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo .;
357|it ' s very spicy but not offensive .;
358|we will definitely go back .;
359|go to volare for 1st class service and terrific food .;
360|the portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter .;
361|the wine list is excellent .;
362|the food is amazing . . . especially if you get the chef ' s tasting menu and your favourite bottle ( or two ! ) of wine from an extensive selection of wines .;
363|the place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded , but the service is excellent and it ' s great for friends out , a romantic date , or a special occassion .;
364|the food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do n ' t like .;
365|please be aware that it ' s cash or amex only !;
366|with the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering , the food here was decent , not great .;
367|we ordered the special , grilled branzino , that was so infused with bone , it was difficult to eat .;
368|the decor in this place is very diner - ish and the kind of place you expect in the east village - not romantic , just simple , small and sparse .;
369|problem is nothing at prune is particularly memorable .;
370|no plans to return anytime soon .;
371|this place is so much fun .;
372|our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant .;
373|our food was great too !;
374|and really large portions .;
375|the staff was the friendliest that have seen in new york .;
376|if you want something really different than try jekyll and hyde .;
377|it is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of disney type special effects .;
378|the food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions .;
379|i highly recommend it .;
380|the place is a lot of fun .;
381|my six year old loved it .;
382|the food however , is what one might expect .;
383|it is very overpriced and not very tasty .;
384|went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them .;
385|service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded .;
386|drinks way over priced .;
387|food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit;
388|great pizza for lunch place .;
389|service was quick .;
390|the pizza was great .;
391|and it was quick which is very important .;
392|have the iced tea .;
393|whenever you need a sushi fix , mizu will be there with quality fish and great service .;
394|delivery is fast too .;
395|great friendly service , fast seating , fast delivery , excellent sushi .;
396|ess - a - bagel ( either by sty - town or midtown ) is by far the best bagel in ny .;
397|the bagels always warm , soft on the inside , crispy on the outside and enormous in size .;
398|they have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great .;
399|the lox is always fresh too .;
400|highly recommended to all !;
401|not impressed with the food .;
402|prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant .;
403|zero ambiance to boot .;
404|i thought this place was totally overrated .;
405|everything we had was good or ok . . . . but definitely nothing great .;
406|the ambience was nice , but service was n ' t so great .;
407|when you add it all together , it just does n ' t seem worth it to me . . . especially considering the prices .;
408|this is the best shabu - shabu restaurant in the try - state area .;
409|thius is a must for anyone who loves shabu - shabu .;
410|the atmosphere is nothing special , but it feels like a sushi establishment in tokyo .;
411|the owner and staff are all japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance .;
412|despite a slightly limited menu , everything prepared is done to perfection , ultra fresh and a work of food art .;
413|i must give it yon out of yon stars !;
414|taxan delicious !;
415|this restaurant was recommended by a local . . . as a matter of fact , he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed !;
416|we were n ' t !;
417|the prices were cheap compared to the quality of service and food .;
418|we liked it so much , that we will always make it a point to dine here when we visit new york .;
419|the location and ambience is ok but the food is what makes up for it .;
420|there is a lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me .;
421|try green curry with vegetables .;
422|the quantity is also very good , you will come out satisfied .;
423|the service is ok , some of the people did n ' t get what they asked for .;
424|i was there on sat . for my birthday and we had an excellent time .;
425|i had the best ravioli ever .;
426|the wine the service was very good too .;
427|moderate prices .;
428|a little noise but i think that was because of our party !;
429|this quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my manhattan restaurant list .;
430|the food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu - fare , the dishes are never a disappointment .;
431|whether it ' s the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar , you will surely be transported to northern italy with one bite .;
432|although the tables may be closely situated , the candle - light , food - quality and service overcompensate .;
433|a guaranteeed delight !;
434|i have known about this secret for the last 13 years , emilio ( the godfather ) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices .;
435|if you go , try the marinara / arrabiatta sauce , the mozzarella en carozza is mmmmmmmm . . . . . everything is just delicious .;
436|i pray it stays open forever .;
437|i found the food , service and value exceptional everytime i have been there .;
438|i felt as though i were eating in paris .;
439|the service was excellent - friendly and attentive .;
440|the prices are wonderfully low .;
441|very good wine choices .;
442|who has room for cheesesticks with the best pizza in nyc !;
443|get the pepperoni - yum - and a family style salad .;
444|great staff .;
445|always great service !;
446|i go twice a month !;
447|the food is good , i ca n ' t lie .;
448|the hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out .;
449|we were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order .;
450|this place is pricey , and yes , the food is worth it ; but the service makes you feel like you should be paying a quater of the price .
451|save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one !;
452|amma is nothing special .;
453|i ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive .;
454|will not be back .;
455|do n ' t dine at tamarind for the vegetarian dishes , they are simply not up to par with the non - veg selections .;
456|this place is always packed .;
457|most importantly , food is excellent .;
458|try the sea bass .;
459|highly recommended .;
460|first of all dal bukhara rocks .;
461|i am happy i did the food was awsome .;
462|and yes dal bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs .;
463|but overall i give it a 10;
464|10;
465|haru on park s is simply disgusting .;
466|the fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale .;
467|quite frankly , this is some of the worst sushi i have ever tried .;
468|will never be back .;
469|honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives .;
470|not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly .;
471|the all - u - can - eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality .;
472|wont come back again for sure !;
473|the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce ( even its low sodium ) , the vinegar - soaked rice , and the scallion on top of the fish .;
474|the waitstaffs are nice though .;
475|i have been to roth ' s twice and both times were very disappointing .;
476|both times i was extremely dissappointed by the service , which was boarderline rude .;
477|they wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another .;
478|much of the time it seems like they do not care about you .;
479|the dinner was ok , nothing i would have again .;
480|this was a great surprise .;
481|i look forward to eating here again;
482|planet thai is great !;
483|we love the food , drinks , and atmosphere !;
484|the svc can be a bit rude at times , esp if you have big group , but overall the restaurant is a must !;
485|try the pad thai , it ' s fabulous and their prices are so cheap !;
486|just because it ' s cheap does not mean the portions are small or the food is nasty , it is great !;
487|they forgot a sandwich , did n ' t include plastic forks , and did n ' t include pita with the hummus platter .;
488|also , the sandwiches ( nearing $ 7 ) did n ' t come with anything like chips or a side .;
489|overall , not worth the money .;
490|eating in , the atmosphere saves it , but at your desk , it ' s a very disappointing experience .;
491|chennai garden is my favorite indian restaurant in the city .;
492|they have authentic indian at amazing prices .;
493|this restaurant is vegetarian ; there are no meat dishes whatsoever .
494|the seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches .;
495|it ' s a rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early .;
496|the food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate .;
497|this is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates .;
498|not a great place for family or general dining .;
499|food is excellent .;
500|fish is so very fresh .;
501|waitstaff are very friendly .;
502|love yuka .;
503|mermaid inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood .;
504|the lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with scallops and shrimp is great .;
505|the service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing .;
506|the only fallback on this restaurant is the prices .;
507|even though its good seafood , the prices are too high .;
508|the lobster sandwich is $ 24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price .;
509|we were very pleasantly surprised .;
510|the food was delicious ( i had a halibut special , my husband had steak ) , and the service was top - notch .;
511|when my dessert came , there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift , and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort .;
512|truly the mark of an attentive waiter .;
513|i highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night .;
514|we ate at this thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods .;
515|we thought that this place is using too much of msg cooking in the foods .;
516|they do n ' t concern much of customer ' s health , just want to make money .;
517|please do n ' t fool us .;
518|i recommend the jelly fish , drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings , certainly the stir fry blue crab .;
519|the food is so cheap and the waiters are nice .;
520|of course , it is crowded but who cares .;
521|authentic shanghai style and i can not recommend a better shanghai place in new york .;
522|have frequented ' ino for several years and the food remains excellent .;
523|cheese plate is a varied delight and great bargain at $ 10 .;
524|the large selection of bruschettas , paninis , tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating .;
525|( the asparagus , truffle oil , parmesan bruschetta is a winner ! );
526|be sure to try the seasonal , and always delicious , specials .;
527|definitely a neighborhood favorite .;
528|i loved this place ! !;
529|i almost hesititate to write a review because the atmosphere was so great and i would hate for it too become to crowded .;
530|i like cafe noir dont get me wrong , it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent ! !;
531|the service was terrible , we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served .;
532|the waitress , seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing .;
533|after dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend , asked him : where are you from . . . maybe you dont know how things work in america . . . and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on .;
534|we did tip , i guess the model / waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager .;
535|pizza here is consistently good .;
536|salads are a delicious way to begin the meal .;
537|it is thick and slightly soggy .;
538|decor is charming .;
539|service is average .;
540|what a great place .;
541|the ambience was so fun , and the prices were great , on top of the fact that the food was really tasty .;
542|i was n ' t thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes , but i guess that ' s the price you pay for a popular place .;
543|i would definitely recommend sea if you like thai cuisine !;
544|i was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever .;
545|a gentleman , maybe the manager , came to our table , and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order .;
546|while it is understandable that every place is indeed different , there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude .;
547|never again !;
548|i absolutely loved this place .;
549|excellent atmosphere , delicious dishes good and friendly service .;
550|this is can became on e of the ny italian food fare institutions .;
551|i think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation .;
552|the wine list is also really nice .;
553|i have been to casimir over 5 times and i have always had a great time there .;
554|the food is great and reasonably priced .;
555|i have tried to make reservations , but both times , the hostess did n ' t have my name .;
556|if the weather is nice , try to snag an outside table .;
557|the staff has been nice , but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often .;
558|my boyfriend and i went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all i can say is that it was magnificent .;
559|from the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff , i felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it .;
560|considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time , the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed .;
561|i highly recommend caviar russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service .;
562|nice family owned traditional restaurant .;
563|i was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in hoboken .;
564|i found the food to be outstanding , particulary the salmon dish i had .;
565|i also ordered the change mojito , which was out of this world .;
566|my friends settled for rice dishes , but we came back the following day to try the dim sum , which was good . . . not outstanding , but good .;
567|we ate out in the back patio , which is worth it as it ' s cool and the music is hear well there .;
568|overall , excellent restaurant !;
569|the food was good .;
570|the place was nice and calm .;
571|but the service was a bit slow .;
572|the buffet had a nice selection .;
573|the food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes .;
574|service was also very good .;
575|i would go back .;
576|i got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries .;
577|i would recommend roxy ' s for that , but not for their food .;
578|my son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge !;
579|but , they were too big for the bun .;
580|consequently , their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did ' nt feel like finishing them .;
581|also they were $ 15 each !;
582|i had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll .;
583|it was $ 14 not really bad for a pound of pastrami - but it did n ' t have much taste - i ' ve had better for less elsewhere !;
584|this place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of a restaurant , the food .;
585|the last two times i ordered from here my food was soo spicy that i could barely eat it , and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish .;
586|and the tom kha soup was pathetic .;
587|if you want good authentic thai this place is not the place to go .;
588|we went here for lunch a couple of weeks ago on a saturday , and i was thoroughly impressed with the food .;
589|the pesto pizza was excellent , thin - crust pizza with a nice amount of spicy italian cheese that i ' d never heard of before .;
590|conveniently located too , being right on bedford ave .;
591|the back garden sitting area is very pleasant , where you can see their personal herb garden .;
592|we had the lobster sandwich and it was fantastic .;
593|my husband said he could ' ve eaten several more , the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had .;
594|we had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful .;
595|we waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right .;
596|love the food .;
597|it ' s the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food .;
598|and you ca n ' t beat the prices .;
599|i ' ve lived in ny for 5 years and this place has it all .;
600|great food , good size menu , great service and an unpretensious setting .;
601|the dishes offered were unique , very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages , sardines with biscuits , large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream ( the best and freshest i ' ve ever had ) .;
602|i ' m glad i was introduced to this place and this is a rare gem in ny .;
603|the freshest , best variety , and the fastest delivery .;
604|also very inexpensive .;
605|the service was excellent and the food was delicious .;
606|we are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included : ceviche mix ( special ) , crab dumplings , assorted sashimi , sushi and rolls , two types of sake , and the banana tempura .;
607|definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date .;
608|average to good thai food , but terrible delivery .;
609|i ' ve waited over one hour for food .;
610|they were very abrupt with me when i called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice .;
611|a thai restaurant out of rice during dinner ?;
612|the food arrived 20 minutes after i called , cold and soggy .;
613|this is a wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money .;
614|an excellent service;
615|we were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial .;
616|she was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering a lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about indian food .;
617|the food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on a variety of fancy plates .;
618|we ended our great experience by having gulab jamun ( dessert ) recommended by the waiter .;
619|i thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others .;
620|service here was great , food was fantastic .;
621|guacamole + shrimp appetizer was really great , we both had the filet , very good , did n ' t much like the frites that came with , but the filet was so good , neither of us cared .;
622|will absolutely visit again .;
623|you can not go wrong with this place .;
624|the food is outstanding and the service is quick , friendly and very professional .;
625|always a nice crowd , but never loud .;
626|go here .;
627|good for dates or with friends .;
628|i am reluctant to write because i would not want my jem of a pizza place to become overcrowded .;
629|however , it is jus too good to not praise it .;
630|by far , the best pizza in manhattan .;
631|the crust is thin , the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly .;
632|the menu has so many fish items and oysters .;
633|the fish was really , really fresh .;
634|we all agreed that mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in new york .;
635|i stumbled upon this great pizzeria as i explored my new neighborhood .;
636|all of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better !;
637|i highly recommend the sophia pizza .;
638|it ' s to die for !;
639|the food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back .;
640|immediately after we paid , the waiter took the money and said , okay , you guys are outta here .;
641|so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary !;
642|for the people who want great food plus great service , roxy is a place to avoid !;
643|the first time the sushi was outstanding , the second time it was a little bland .;
644|i ' m sure i ' ll return for a final judgement tho .;
645|the blond wood decor is very soothing , the premium sake is excellent and the service is great .;
646|mizu is the japenese find in grammercy .;
647|while their kitchen food is delicious , their sushi is out of this world .;
648|mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else .;
649|not only is the cuisine the best around , the service has always been attentive and charming .;
650|warning : you may find it difficult to dine at other japanese restaurants after a visit to mizu !;
